        Three agent apps using LLMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini-flash are presented as follows:

        - [LangChain LLM Agent](https://langchain-llm-agent.streamlit.app/),
          which implements agents using LangChain. GPT models from OpenAI,
          Claude models from Anthropic, or Gemini models from Google can be used
          together with tools such as internet search, python REPL, RAG, etc.

        - [OpenAI Assistants](https://assistants.streamlit.app/),
          which enables users to create their own custom
          chatbots using the Assistants API from OpenAI.

        - [Multi-Agent Debate](https://multi-agent-debate.streamlit.app/),
          which enables two agents to debate on a given topic. GPT-4o from OpenAI
          is employed using LangChain.

        In these apps, tools such as searching the internet, ArXiv, Wikipedia,
        or uploaded documents (retrieval) can be used. Python REPL is also
        supported.
