        - [LangChain OpenAI Agent](https://langchain-openai-agent.streamlit.app/),
          which implements ChatGPT (with images), RAG (Retrieval Augmented
          Generation), and DALLÂ·E using OpenAI and LangChain functions.
          Internet search is also supported by Tavily Sesrch.

        - [OpenAI Assistants](https://assistants.streamlit.app/),
          which enables users to create their own custom
          chatbots using the Assistants API; such tools as
          retrieval, code interpreter, and Tavily Search can be used.
