        ### What this site is for
        
        * This site is for my students and currently covers the following
          toy examples:

          - Simulation of dynamical systems described by differential
            equations
        
          - PID control of an inverted pendulum on a cart as an example of
            a feedback control system

          - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and its relation
            to PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
          
          - SVD of an image file, which results in some sort of image compression
          
          - Fourier transform (of sound waves), which is an essential concept
            in signals and systems

          - Simulation of the Monty Hall problem, a popular probability puzzle
            in which a contestant has a probability of winning a car that is
            at least 1/3

          - Classification algorithms as an introduction to machine learning

          - Implementation of ChatGPT (with images), RAG (Retrieval Augmented
            Generation), and DALL¬∑E using OpenAI and langchain functions;
            Voice recognition and Text-To-Speech (TTS) are supported

          - Implementation of OpenAI assistants using the Assistants API,
            enabling users to create their own custom chatbots; tools such
            as retrieval and code interpreter can be used.

        * You can find more examples on dynamic systems written as
          differential equations on
          [TWY's Page for Differential Equations](https://diff-eqn.streamlit.app/).

        * All the pages and scripts are written in python using the Streamlit
          framework.
    
        #### What TWY does
    
        * TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
          technical writing, etc., at Korea University.
