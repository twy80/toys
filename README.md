# [TWY's Playground](https://twy-playground.streamlit.app/)

* This is for my students and currently covers the following
  toy examples:
  
  - Simulation of dynamical systems described by differential equations

  - PID control of an inverted pendulum on a cart as an example of
    a feedback control system

  - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and its relation
    to PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

  - SVD of an image file, which results in some sort of image
    compression

  - Fourier transform (of sound waves), which is an essential
    concept in signals and systems

  - Simulation of the Monty Hall problem, a popular probability puzzle
    in which a contestant has a probability of winning a car that is
    at least 1/3

  - Classification algorithms as an introduction to machine learning

  - Implementation of ChatGPT, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation),
    and DALL·E with STT and TTS using OpenAI and langchain functions.


* All the pages and scripts are written in python using the
  Streamlit framework. You can find more examples on dynamic
  systems written as differential equations on
  [TWY's Page for Differential Equations](https://diff-eqn.streamlit.app/).


* TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
  technical writing, etc., at Korea University.

## Usage
```python
streamlit run Home.py
```
